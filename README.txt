Implementation for solving 2D mazes using Java

a. Depth First Search
b. Breadth First Search
c. Iterative Deepening
d. Uniform Cost Search
e. Greedy Best First Search
f. A* Heuristic Search

Program gets a maze described under input/maze.txt, and finds the goal node starting from start node.

The order of node expansion is East, South, West and North. 

An example maze is as follows:

For the above maze and for each search method, program displays on output/.*.txt
i. The cost of the solution found.
ii. The solution path itself.
iii. The list of expanded nodes.
