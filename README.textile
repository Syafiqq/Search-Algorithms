h2. Java implementation for solving 2D mazes

#Depth First Search
#Breadth First Search
#Iterative Deepening
#Uniform Cost Search
#Greedy Best First Search
#A* Heuristic Search


Program gets a maze described under input/maze.txt, and finds the goal node starting from the start node.

The order of node expansion is East, South, West and North. 

An example maze is as follows:

For the above maze, finds and writes below issues on output/.*.txt
i. The cost of the solution found.
ii. The solution path itself.
iii. The list of expanded nodes.
